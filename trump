we had a great time and one of your very nice districts you know where I'm talking about and I was told between the
weather and we decided brilliantly to rent a small plane because it could save
you about 15 minutes if you drove and we did we rented a small we land with the
big one we got into a small one cuz the runways were a little small for the other one and to save 15 minutes it took
us a couple of hours because the small plane didn't work somebody in Iowa had a plane that
was for rent and we said let's take that play we'll save a couple of minutes but
you know my people were great they said look the people of Clinton won't mind sir you can cancel and it'll be
fine they said sir honestly you could cancel they won't mind at all and I said
there's no way I'm canceling Clinton there's no
way man do we get an A for effort though that was that was quite a trip that was
quite a trip but there was no way I would never even think about it especially when I saw the lines that's all over the Internet the lines of
people going back so far so I want to thank you I wouldn't have the courage to do it
if you want to know the truth we have courage to do a lot of things but we'll start by just saying hello Iowa you're
going to win this election for us so big happy New Year happy New Year because
nine days from now the people of this state are going to cast the most important vote of your entire lives and
I used to say that 2016 I'd say that and I meant it but this is more important because they're destroying your nation
they are destroying your nation like nobody's ever seen before what they've done is so sad in every way the borders
the military you look at all this inflation killing you Afghanistan you know the press the fake news wants to
forget about Afghanistan the incompetence which led to other things like Putin going into Ukraine he went
into Ukraine he saw the incompetence of Afghanistan he says let's give it a shot why not they wouldn't have done it with
me they wouldn't have attacked Israel with me they wouldn't have attacked there was no way Iran was broke they
were broke when I was president and they became very rich in the last three years because of Biden Biden most corrupt
president we've ever had the worst president we've ever had worst president we've ever had you
know and it's nice because he's an older guy but this is I think it's really nice
Jimmy Carter is happy right now because his administration is
brilliant it's brilliant people say he had a brilliant Administration compared to Joe Biden crooked Joe Biden I would
say Jimmy Carter was a brilliant president all of a sudden first time
and I hope he likes hearing that because I mean it by delivering a massive victory in Iowa you will send a
thundering message straight to Crooked Joe Biden and the fake news look at all those cameras back there that's a
lot to the fake news media and all of the evil and Sinister people trying to
destroy this nation with you vote for our campaign on Monday January 15th it's

great Thrills here great victories here we won two elections do you know that if you win Florida Ohio and Iowa in history
there's never been a president that lost the election except for me you know was
a rigged election now if you win Florida think of it Florida Ohio and Iowa
